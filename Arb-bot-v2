//In this updated version, the getPrice() function on each exchange is called inside a try block. If an error occurs, it is caught by the catch block 
//and the function returns without executing a trade. This ensures that the bot will not try to execute a trade if it is unable to retrieve the current 
//prices on the exchanges. Additionally, an event is emitted when a trade is successfully executed, which can be used to log the trade and its profit.
